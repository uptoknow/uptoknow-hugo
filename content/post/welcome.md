Hello, welcome to visit my blog, I am a programer, java, python, bash, golang, ruby on rails,uptoknow means up to know, from unknow to know, which means keep learning, unknow will the know, I am a little lazy, I found when I learn some new things, I will forgot soon withoug record it, so I decide start to write blogs to sumarize the new tech I have learned, it's easy to learn something, but it's not easy to write a blog to systematize it.
